## ðŸŽµ AuralCanvas (OpenCV)

**Goal:** Develop an emotion-based playlist algorithm through facial recognition

**Tech Stack:** OpenCV, Machine Learning

**Features:**

* Real-time facial emotion detection
* Emotion-to-playlist mapping (e.g., happy â†’ upbeat, sad â†’ mellow)
* Dynamic music queue based on current mood
* Option to select or override detected emotion
* Local music or streaming API integration
* Track history & emotion log

### Workflow & Milestones Checklist

#### MVP 1: Setup & Basic Emotion Detection
- [ ] Set up OpenCV environment and webcam integration
- [ ] Implement real-time facial detection
- [ ] Display detected emotions on screen in real-time

#### MVP 2: Emotion-to-Playlist Mapping
- [ ] Define emotion categories and corresponding playlist moods
- [ ] Create static playlists mapped to emotions (local or sample data)
- [ ] Implement logic to select playlist based on detected emotion

#### MVP 3: Music Integration & Playback
- [ ] Integrate Spotify API or local music player
- [ ] Play music based on selected playlist automatically
- [ ] Implement dynamic music queue updates based on emotion changes

#### MVP 4: User Controls & Overrides
- [ ] Add UI option to manually select or override detected emotion
- [ ] Allow pausing, skipping, or replaying tracks
- [ ] Track history of played songs and corresponding emotions

#### MVP 5: Logging & Refinement
- [ ] Log detected emotions with timestamps and tracks played
- [ ] Improve accuracy and responsiveness of emotion detection
- [ ] Optimize performance and user experience
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
